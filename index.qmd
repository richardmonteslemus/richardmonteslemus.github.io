My passion lies at the intersection of machine learning and conservation. I strive for a harmonious blend between technology and nature in everything I do. Whether it be using machine learning to monitor mammals in the channel islands to applying a physics based model that removed the water from underwater reef images in order to be able to more easily use machine learning for quantifying coral bleaching from reef images.
