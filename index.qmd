Welcome! I’m Richie Montes Lemus.

My passion lies at the intersection of machine learning and conservation. I strive for a harmonious blend between technology and nature in everything I do. Some of my major projects have involved optimizing a machine learning model for monitoring the Island Spotted Skunk via camera traps on Santa Cruz Island, CA, as well as developing scripts and a protocol that apply a method for removing water’s effects from reef images to improve coral bleaching quantification. 

Outside of research, I love trying different teas, hiking, and browsing Trader Joe’s. I graduated from the University of California Santa Barbara (UCSB) with a B.S. in Environmental Studies and am currently pursuing my Master’s in Environmental Data Science at UCSB’s Bren School.
