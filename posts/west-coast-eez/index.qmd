## Sustainable Protein Production Challenges

With the global population approaching 10 billion by 2050, protein demand has continuously risen. Terrestrial livestock has increased to meet this demand - degrading the environment in the process. Marine aquaculture, however, offers an attractive solution to this problem. It is associated with lower carbon emissions, reduced freshwater use, and minimal land use compared to terrestrial livestock [@Gephart2021].

Implementing this alternative requires finding locations with specific temperature, depth, and other environmental factors needed for particular marine species. Finding these optimal zones with spatial analysis would encourage sustainable aquaculture within an Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) like the U.S's West coast. Exclusive Economic Zones are maritime zones extending up to 200 nautical miles from a country's coastline, a country has special rights to the exploration and use of marine resources in this zone.  

### Research Question

**Where are the most suitable locations along the U.S. West Coast for cultivating oysters and California spiny lobsters?**

This analysis uses sea surface temperature data and ocean depth to produce a map containing optimal environmental conditions for these two commercially valuable species.

## Data & Methods

### Data Sources

This analysis uses the following datasets:

1.  **Sea Surface Temperature (SST)**: Average annual temperature raster tiff data (2008-2012) from NOAA Coral Reef Watch, providing a five-year baseline to capture climate variability
2.  **Ocean Depth**: Bathymetry raster data from the GEBCO 2022 Grid
3.  **EEZ Boundaries**: West Coast Exclusive Economic Zone boundary shapefiles from the Flanders Marine Institute

### Species Requirements

Based on the species-specific biological research from SeaLifeBase [@Palomares2025], I found the following optimal conditions for my species of interest.

**Oysters:**

- Depth: 0 to -70 meters 

- Temperature: 11°C to 30°C

**California Spiny Lobster:** 

- Depth: 0 to -150 meters

- Temperature: 14.8°C to 22.3°C

### Analytical Approach

The analysis workflow involved:

1.  **Data preparation**: Transforming coordinate reference systems to match spatial extents and resolutions across all datasets. This will allow us to conduct zonal statistics between them and plot them on a map together.
2.  **Temperature processing**: Calculating mean sea surface temperature (SST) (2008-2012) and converting from Kelvin to Celsius. This ensures we have a robust SST informed by the historical temperatures of the area and is in a temperature people are familiar with. 
3.  **Finding suitable areas**: Reclassifying temperature and depth rasters to identify suitable areas (binary: suitable = 1, unsuitable = 0). This returns a raster that only meets our suitability condition.
4.  **Area calculation**: Calculating suitable area (km²) within each EEZ region using zonal statistics. This allows us to quantify how suitable each EEZ is based on area of suitability. 
5. **Create Function**: Creating a function that takes in minimum sea surface temperature,  maximum sea surface temperature, minimum sea depth, maximum sea depth, and species name to create a map that colors each exclusive economic zone on the US west coast by suitable area quantity in km^2. This makes the workflow generalizable.

## Results

### Oyster Aquaculture Suitability

The analysis finds the most suitable EEZs for oyster aquaculture across the U.S. West Coast:

```{r}
kable(suitable_oyster_region, 
      col.names = c("EEZ Region", "Suitable Area (km²)"),
      caption = "Oyster Aquaculture Suitable Area per EEZ Region",
      format.args = list(big.mark = ","))
```

**Central California** is found to be the most suitable region for oyster aquaculture since it contains the largest area of optimal conditions.

### California Spiny Lobster Suitability

                fill.legend = tm_legend(title = "Suitable Area (km²)",
                                        position = c(0.6, 0.9))) + 
    tm_scalebar(position = c(0.25, 0.15)) + 
    tm_compass(position = c(0.3, 0.35)) + 
    tm_title(text = paste(species_name, "Aquaculture Suitability")) +
    tm_layout(asp = 1.8,
              legend.title.size = 0.7, 
              legend.text.size = 0.5,   
              legend.width = 13,       
              legend.height = 15,
              title.position = c(0.05, 1.08), 
              frame = FALSE)
  
  return(map)
}
```

```{r fig.width=6, fig.height=4, fig.cap="West Coast EEZ regions colored by suitable California spiny lobster aquaculture area (km²). The warmer waters of Southern California provide optimal habitat."}
eez_map(14.8, 22.3, 0, -150, "California Spiny Lobster")
```

**Southern California** is found to be the most suitable region for California spiny lobster aquaculture since it contains the largest area of optimal conditions - warmer waters and appropriate depth profiles.

## Discussion & Implications

### Key Findings

This spatial analysis maps potential aquaculture EEZs for Oyster and California spiny lobster.

-   **Central California** is optimal for oyster cultivation, with moderate temperatures and shallow coastal waters
-   **Southern California** is best suited for California spiny lobster, with warmer waters and appropriate depths

### Limitations

The following limitation should be considered:

1.  **Simplified environmental criteria**: This analysis only considers temperature and depth. Additional factors should be considered in order to find more accurate optimal zones.

### Conclusion

Given the increasing demand for protein and depleted wild fisheries, marine aquaculture offers a sustainable pathway [@FAO2020]. Spatial tools like this analysis can help guide development in appropriate exclusive economic zones. [@Gentry2017].
