I strive for a harmonious blend between technology and nature in everything I do. Some of my major projects have involved machine learning for monitoring the Island Spotted Skunk and applying underwater colorimetry models to reef images in order to improve coral bleaching quantification.\nOutside of research, I love trying different teas, hiking, and browsing Trader Joe’s. I graduated from the University of California Santa Barbara (UCSB) with a B.S. in Environmental Studies and am currently pursuing my Master’s in Environmental Data Science at UCSB’s Bren School."
