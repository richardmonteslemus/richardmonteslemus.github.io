    "text": "Sustainable Protein Production Challenges\nWith the global population approaching 10 bilion by 2050, protein demand has continuously risen. Terrestial livestock has increased to meet this demand - degrading the environment in the process. Marine aquaculture, however, offers a attractive solution to this problem. It is associated with lower carbon emissions, reduced freshwater use, and minimal land use compared to terrestrial livestock (Gephart et al. 2021).\nImplementing this alternative requires finding locations with specific temperature, depth, and other environmental factors needed for particular marine species. Finding these optimal zones with spatial analysis would encourage sustainable aquaculture within Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) like the U.S’s West coast.\n\nResearch Question\nWhere are the most suitable locations along the U.S. West Coast for cultivating oysters and California spiny lobsters?\nThis analysis uses sea surface temperature data and ocean depth to produce a map containing optimal environmental conditions for these two commercially valuable species."

    "title": "Evaluating California’s Sustainable Groundwater Management Act",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Link to Github Repository This repository contains code, file structures, and references for the following California Sustainable Groundwater Management Act analysis.\n\nAbout\nIn 2014, California passed the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA) aimed at addressing the over-exploitation of groundwater across California (Water Education Foundation, n.d.). The need for groundwater regulation was made urgent by the severe California drought of 2012-2016. This act required local and regional agencies to develop and implement sustainable groundwater management plans. High and medium-priority basins in critical overdraft were required to submit and begin implementing management plans by January 2020, while the rest had until January 2022 (Water Education Foundation, n.d.).\nThis analysis uses a segmented regression model to evaluate whether groundwater level trends changed after SGMA implementation. The analysis examines water surface elevations from January 2012 through November 2025 for monitoring wells across California operated by the California Department of Water Resources.\n\n\nData limitation\nThe groundwater level data used in this analysis exhibits several features that affect the statistical analysis:\nSeasonality: Groundwater levels fluctuate seasonally, increasing during wet seasons and decreasing during dry periods. This could make it difficult to distinguish seasonal groundwater water depletion from over drafting.\nAutocorrelation not addressed: This analysis does not account for autocorrelation in the regression model. Groundwater levels depend on previous levels. This creates autocorrelation for our response variables. Therefore, groundwater level observations cannot be considered independent. This can affect the reliability of standard errors and significance tests.\nPolicy Intervention Variation: Not all wells were subject to the January 2020 SGMA Sustainable Groundwater Plan submission and implementation. Some wells had until January 2022 to start implementing their plan. Despite this, a single policy intervention date (January 2020) was used in order to make a single breakpoint for groundwater level observations over time.\n\n\nReferences\nCalifornia Department of Water Resources.

The model found the breakpoint to be month 126.86 which corresponds to approximately September 2022. This is about 2.5 years later than the expected breakpoint of January 2020. While it is possible that this is due to the implementation of groundwater management plans taking a while to impact groundwater levels, it is more probable that this breakpoint is attributed to extreme weather events. Around September 2022, California experienced extreme precipitation events that replenished groundwater levels all over the state. Therefore, it is difficult to make a distinction between extreme precipitation helping and SGMA plans affecting groundater levels.\nCoefficients:\nTime: 0.3121 feet/month This coefficient corresponds to the pre-breakpoint slope. On average, before the breakpoint, groundwater levels increased by about 0.3121 feet per month. This positive slope is likely due to the 2012 - 2016 California drought causing a low initial groundwater level. It is statistically significant with a p value of 0.0101.\nU1.Time: 11.7201 feet/month This coefficient corresponds to the post-breakpoint slope. On average, after the breakpoint, groundwater levels increased by about 11.7201 feet per month. This steep increase in slope is likely due to extreme precipitation events that occurred after the breakpoint. The model was unable to calculate a p value for this slope.\nModel Fit: R^2 = 0.8648\nThis model explains about 86.7% of the variability in groundwater levels during selected dates. This indicated a strong model fit.\nBreakpoint: The model calculated the breakpoint to be month 126.86 which is approximately September 2022.\nConfidence Interval: Time: 0.12 feet/month The standard error corresponds to the pre-breakpoint slope. We are 95% confident the slope is between 0.07 and 0.55 feet per month. Since zero is not included, we are confident groundwater levels were rising before the breakpoint.\nU1.Time: 0.72 feet/month The standard error corresponds to the post-breakpoint slope. Since we did not receive a P value for this slope we are unable to make claims about the confidence in the slope range.\nBreakpoint: 1.534 months The standard error corresponds to the breakpoint estimate. We are 95% confident the breakpoint falls between month 124 - 130 (July 2022 - November 2022).\n\n\nGenerate predicitons\nCreate a grid of predictions to input into model\n\n# Create grid of predictions for entire time range \npred_grid &lt;- expand_grid(\n  Time = seq(0, max(station_month_avg$Time), by = 1)  # Have every month from 0 to end \n)\n\n# Generate predictions using model and grid\nsegmented_predictions &lt;- pred_grid %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    predicted_WSE = predict(sgma_segmented, newdata = pred_grid),\n    MSMT_DATE = min(station_month_avg$MSMT_DATE) + months(Time), # Add date \n    period = ifelse(Time &lt; sgma_segmented$psi[2], \"Pre-breakpoint\", \"Post-breakpoint\") # Set pre and post breakpoint categories\n  )\n\n# Assign predicted breakpoint \nbreakpoint_date &lt;- ymd(\"2022-09-01\")\n\n\n\nPlot predictions\n\n# Plot observed data and predicted segmented regression lines\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(data = station_month_avg, \n             aes(x = MSMT_DATE, y = mean_WSE),\n             alpha = 0.5, size = 2, color = \"gray40\") +\n  # Plot predicted segmented regression line\n  geom_line(data = segmented_predictions,\n            aes(x = MSMT_DATE, y = predicted_WSE, color = period)) +\n  # Vertical line at model breakpoint\n  geom_vline(xintercept = breakpoint_date,\n             linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"red\", size = 1) +\n  # Vertical line at SGMA implementation\n  geom_vline(xintercept = ymd(\"2020-01-01\"),\n             linetype = \"dotted\", color = \"darkgreen\", size = 1) +\n  annotate(\"text\", \n           x = breakpoint_date,\n           y = 750,\n           label = \"Model-estimated\\nbreakpoint\\n(Sept 2022)\",\n           color = \"red\", hjust = -0.1, size = 2) +\n  annotate(\"text\",\n           x = ymd(\"2020-01-01\"),\n           y = 200,\n           label = \"SGMA\\nimplementation\\n(Jan 2020)\",\n           color = \"darkgreen\", hjust = 1.1, size = 2) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"Pre-breakpoint\" = \"cornflowerblue\", \n                                  \"Post-breakpoint\" = \"firebrick\"),\n                     name = \"Time Period\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Segmented Regression Model: Observed vs. Predicted Groundwater Levels in California\",\n    x = \"Date\",\n    y = \"Mean Water Surface Elevation (feet)\",\n    caption = \"Points = observed monthly averages; Lines = segmented regression predictions\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 11, face = \"bold\"),\n    legend.position = \"bottom\"\n  )\n\nWarning: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `linewidth` instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following code plots the observed and predicted groundwater water surface elevation.
