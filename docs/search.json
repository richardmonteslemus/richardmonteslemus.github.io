    "text": "Sustainable Protein Production Challenges\nWith the global population approaching 10 billion by 2050, protein demand has continuously risen. Terrestrial livestock has increased to meet this demand - degrading the environment in the process. Marine aquaculture, however, offers a attractive solution to this problem. It is associated with lower carbon emissions, reduced freshwater use, and minimal land use compared to terrestrial livestock (Gephart et al. 2021).\nImplementing this alternative requires finding locations with specific temperature, depth, and other environmental factors needed for particular marine species. Finding these optimal zones with spatial analysis would encourage sustainable aquaculture within an Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) like the U.S’s West coast. Exclusive Economic Zones are maritime zones extending up to 200 nautical miles from a country’s coastline, a country has special rights to the exploration and use of marine resources in this zone.\n\nResearch Question\nWhere are the most suitable locations along the U.S. West Coast for cultivating oysters and California spiny lobsters?\nThis analysis uses sea surface temperature data and ocean depth to produce a map containing optimal environmental conditions for these two commercially valuable species."

This will alllow us to conduct zonal statistics between them and plot them on a map together.\nTemperature processing: Calculating mean sea surface temperature (SST) (2008-2012) and converting from Kelvin to Celsius. This ensures we have a robust SST informed by the historical temperatures of the area and is in a temperature people are familar with.\nFinding suitable areas: Reclassifying temperature and depth rasters to identify suitable areas (binary: suitable = 1, unsuitable = 0). This returns a raster that only meets our suitability condition.\nArea calculation: Calculating suitable area (km²) within each EEZ region using zonal statistics. This allows us to quantify how suitable each EEZ is based on area of suitability.\nCreate Function: Creating a function that takes in minimum sea surface temperature, maximum sea surface temperature, minimum sea depth, maximum sea depth, and species name to create a map that colors each exclusive economic zone on the US west coast by suitable area quantity in km^2. This makes the workflow generalizable."

Burned car due to Eaton Fire\n\n\nFigure 1. Burned car due to Eaton Fire.\nPhoto by Frederic J. Brown/AFP via Getty Images.\n\n\n\nAbout\n\nPurpose:\nThe Eaton and Palisades fires of January 2025, exacerbated by Santa Ana winds, wreaked havoc across Southern California. Thousands of homes were burned and residents displaced.\nThis notebook uses false color imagery to visualize the aftermath of the Eaton and Palisades fires as of February 23, 2025.\nFurthermore, this analysis examines limited English proficiency (LEP) populations within the fire perimeters to highlight language barriers during emergency response. Emergency alerts were disseminated only in English and Spanish, leaving communities speaking other languages without access to life-saving information. According to UCLA researchers, nearly 50,000 Asian Americans were impacted by these fires, with over 12,000 having limited English proficiency and facing significant communication barriers.\nData Limitation: The LEP metric used in this analysis includes all individuals who speak English “less than well,” which includes Spanish speakers who did receive alerts in Spanish. This means the visualizations overestimate the population that was truly excluded from emergency communications. Ideally, this analysis would isolate non-English, non-Spanish speaking populations, but this data is not available in the current EJScreen dataset. Despite this limitation, the maps still reveal census tracts with high concentrations of language isolated populations and highlight the need for more multilingual emergency alert systems.\n\n\nHighlights:\n\nPlotting RGB true color map\nPlotting False-color image map (SWIR‑NIR‑Red)\nPlotting False-color image map (SWIR‑NIR‑Red) within Eaton and Palisades parameters\nPlotting census tracts with limited English proficiency within Eaton and Palisades parameters\n\n\n\nData descriptions:\nEaton_Perimeter_20250121.shp - This data consists of Eaton dissolved perimeter data from Los Angeles County.\nPalisades_Perimeter_20250121.shp - This data consists of Palisades dissolved perimeter data from Los Angeles County.\nlandsat8-2025-02-23-palisades-eaton.nc - This Landsat data consists of atmospherically corrected surface reflectance and surface temperature image data.\nEJI_2024_California.gdp - This data consist of several environmental justice variables and corresponsing census tracts and geometry.\n\n\nReferences:\n[1] ArcGIS Online.

Importantly xarray is used to work with multi-dimensional arrays like NETCDF. netCDF4 is used to read in data in the NetCDF format - a common format for climate/satelite data. And contextily will be used for adding a basemap to map.\n\n# Import libraries\nimport os\nimport pandas as pd\nimport geopandas as gpd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\nimport xarray as xr   \nimport netCDF4\nimport contextily as ctx\n\n\n\nRead in fire perimeter data\nThis step reads in two seperate shapefiles of the Eaton and Palisades fire perimeters represented as polygons. These contain “Heat Perimeter” polygons showing fire boundaries.\n\n# Read in Palisades and Eaton fire perimeter data \nfp_eaton = os.path.join('data','Eaton_Perimeter_20250121','Eaton_Perimeter_20250121.shp')\neaton = gpd.read_file(fp_eaton)\n\nfp_pal = os.path.join('data','Palisades_Perimeter_20250121','Palisades_Perimeter_20250121.shp')\npalisades = gpd.read_file(fp_pal)\n\n\n\nCheck fire perimeter CRS\nThe following lines of code extract the CRS of our fire perimeter data. They are both EPSG:3857, the Web Mercator projected coordinate system.\n\n# Check the projection and coordinate reference system of data \nprint(eaton.crs)\n\nEPSG:3857\n\n\n\n# Check the projection and coordinate reference system of data \nprint(palisades.crs)\n\nEPSG:3857\n\n\n\n\nExplore fire perimeter data contents\nBoth the fire perimeters contain the following columns, OBJECTID, type, Shape_Are, Shape_Len, and Geometry for each row representing an individual polygon feature. OBJECTID is an int64 type and the unique identifier, type is an object containing a string describing the feature.” Shape_Are is a float64 data type containing a number representing the area of the polygon, and Shape_Len is a float64 data type containg a number representing the length of the polygon. Lastly, the geometry column is a geometry data type containing the polygon spatial object used for mapping.\n\n# Check the first 5 rows of data \neaton.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOBJECTID\ntype\nShape__Are\nShape__Len\ngeometry\n\n\n\n\n0\n1\nHeat Perimeter\n2206.265625\n270.199719\nPOLYGON ((-13146936.686 4051222.067, -13146932...\n\n\n1\n2\nHeat Perimeter\n20710.207031\n839.204218\nPOLYGON ((-13150835.463 4052713.929, -13150831...\n\n\n2\n3\nHeat Perimeter\n3639.238281\n250.304502\nPOLYGON ((-13153094.697 4053057.596, -13153113...\n\n\n3\n4\nHeat Perimeter\n1464.550781\n148.106792\nPOLYGON ((-13145097.740 4053118.235, -13145100...\n\n\n4\n5\nHeat Perimeter\n4132.753906\n247.960744\nPOLYGON ((-13153131.126 4053196.882, -13153131...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Check the first 5 rows of data \npalisades.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOBJECTID\ntype\nShape__Are\nShape__Len\ngeometry\n\n\n\n\n0\n1\nHeat Perimeter\n1182.082031\n267.101144\nPOLYGON ((-13193543.302 4032913.077, -13193543...\n\n\n1\n2\nHeat Perimeter\n2222.488281\n185.498783\nPOLYGON ((-13193524.155 4033067.953, -13193524...\n\n\n2\n3\nHeat Perimeter\n21.011719\n22.412814\nPOLYGON ((-13193598.085 4033158.222, -13193598...\n\n\n3\n4\nHeat Perimeter\n214.992188\n76.639180\nPOLYGON ((-13193654.249 4033146.033, -13193656...\n\n\n4\n5\nHeat Perimeter\n44203.453125\n1569.259764\nPOLYGON ((-13194209.580 4033236.320, -13194209...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Check data column types \neaton.dtypes\n\nOBJECTID         int64\ntype            object\nShape__Are     float64\nShape__Len     float64\ngeometry      geometry\ndtype: object\n\n\n\n# Check data column types \npalisades.dtypes\n\nOBJECTID         int64\ntype            object\nShape__Are     float64\nShape__Len     float64\ngeometry      geometry\ndtype: object\n\n\n\n\nRead in satellite imagery data\nRead in Landsat satelite imagery from February 23, 2025 in NetCDF format using xarray.\n\n# Read in collection of bands data \nlandsat = xr.open_dataset(os.path.join(\"data\",\"landsat8-2025-02-23-palisades-eaton.nc\"))\n\n\n\nExplore satelite imagery data\nThis Landsat data is stored in a NetCDF data format with each layer being a matrix. Upon exploring this data, I found that it is 3 dimensional. it contains one layer representing time, and another two representing x and y coordinates on a map. Y coordinates decrease as you go down (south) and X coordinates increase as you go right (east). Its CRS is EPSG:32611 (UTM Zone 11N), its units are meters, and its resolution is 30 meters and it is projected. It contains the red, green, blue, nir08, and swir22 bands. Red, green, and blue bands are within the visible light spectrum humans see, they represent images in their “true color” form. Nir08 is a band within the near-infrared spectrum, vegetation is highly reflective in this spectrum. Swir22 is a band within the shortwave infrared spectrum, burn scars are highly reflective in this spectrum.\n\n# Print Landsat data and explore

region impacted by fires\nThis step plots the region of Southern California that experienced the Eaton and Palisades fires in true color imagery. This means I used the red, green, and blue band to create a map of the region. It will allow me to see what this map looked like before I plot it in false color imagery.\nOriginally, this map did not plot well - it plotted a blank map. I discovered this was due to the fact that my data contained NaN values and extreme outliers corresponding to bright clouds. The following steps will address these issues.\nIn order remove the NaNs in my data, I will turn all NaN values into zeros and print the number of NaN values to ensure they are gone. This will ensure I don’t get a warning when I plot my map.\n\n# Check number of NAs in each band\nfor band in [\"red\",\"green\",\"blue\"]:\n    print(band, np.isnan(landsat[band]).sum().item())\n\nred 0\ngreen 1\nblue 109\n\n\n\n# Substitute nan with zero \nlandsat = landsat.fillna(0)\n\n# Ensure nas are converted into zero\nfor band in [\"red\",\"green\",\"blue\"]:\n    print(band, np.isnan(landsat[band]).sum().item())\n\nred 0\ngreen 0\nblue 0\n\n\nIn order to remove the extreme outliers in my data caused by bright clouds I will use robust=true for my figure. This will remove the top and bottom 2% values in my data and allow me to plot a map without distorted colors.\n\n# Create rgb map of Southern California post-fire\nfigure = (landsat[[\"red\",\"green\",\"blue\"]].to_array()\n                                         .plot\n                                         .imshow(robust=True)) # Remove outliers with robust\n\n# Add axis labels and title\nax = figure.axes\nax.set_title(\"Southern California Landsat RGB Image (Feb 23, 2025)\")\n\n# Remove ticks \nax.set_xticks([])         \nax.set_yticks([])  \n\n# Remove x and y labels\nax.set_ylabel(\"\")\nax.set_xlabel(\"\")\n\nText(0.5, 0, '')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlot false color image of region impacted by fires\nThis step plots the region of Southern California that experienced the Eaton and Palisades fires in false color imagery. False color imagery is the practice of assigning non-rgb bands to rgb band colors in order to highlight certain features that are more visible in those non-rgb bands.\nIn this case, we plot the nir08 band as green. Nir08 is a band within the near-infrared spectrum, vegetation is highly reflective in this spectrum and therefore we will visualize healthy vegetation as green. We will also plot swir22 as red. Swir22 is a band within the shortwave infrared spectrum, burn scars are highly reflective in this spectrum and therefore we will visualize burn scars as red. This contrast between these bands will highlight burned regions clearer than it would in the rgb visible light spectrum.\n\n# Create false color image map of Southern California post-fire\nfigure = (landsat[[\"swir22\",\"nir08\",\"red\"]].to_array()\n                                         .plot\n                                         .imshow(robust=True)) # Remove outliers with robust\n\n# Add axis labels and title\nax = figure.axes\nax.set_title(\"Southern California Landsat False‑Color (SWIR‑NIR‑Red) (Feb, 23, 2025)\")\n\n# Remove ticks \nax.set_xticks([])         \nax.set_yticks([])  \n\n# Remove x and y labels\nax.set_ylabel(\"\")\nax.set_xlabel(\"\")\n\nText(0.5, 0, '')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMap fire perimeters onto false color map\nThis step will plot the Eaton and Palisades fire perimeters onto our false color map in order for us to see which burn scars correspond to which fire.\nBefore we plot the perimeters onto the map we need to make all of their crs match.\n\n# Reproject fire perimeters to match Landsat CRS\neaton = eaton.to_crs(landsat.rio.crs)\npalisades = palisades.to_crs(landsat.rio.crs)\n\n# Assert that CRS now match\nassert eaton.crs == landsat.rio.crs and palisades.crs == landsat.rio.crs, \"CRS mismatch after conversion\"\n\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 1)\n\neaton.boundary.plot( # Plot fire perimeter boundary\n    ax = ax, \n    alpha = 0.9,\n    edgecolor = \"purple\",\n    label=\"Eaton Fire\")\n\npalisades.boundary.plot( # Plot fire perimeter boundary\n    ax = ax, \n    alpha = 0.9,\n    edgecolor = \"blue\",\n    label=\"Palisades Fire\")\n\n# Address cloud outlier problem\nlandsat[[\"swir22\",\"nir08\",\"red\"]].to_array().plot.imshow(ax = ax, \n                                                         robust=True)\n\nax.set_title('Southern California Landsat False‑Color (SWIR‑NIR‑Red) with Eaton and Palisades Perimeters (Feb, 23, 2025)', fontsize = 9)\nax.set_xlabel(\"Easting (meters)\")\nax.set_ylabel(\"Northing (meters)\")\nax.legend(loc=\"upper right\")\n\n# Remove ticks \nax.set_xticks([])         \nax.set_yticks([])   \n\n# Remove x and y labels\nax.set_ylabel(\"\")\nax.set_xlabel(\"\")\n\ntxt=txt = (\n    \"Figure 1: The extent of the Eaton and Palisades fire were mapped using false color imagery.

Then, I matched its crs to the crs for the Eaton and Palisades fire perimeters. Then, I inner joined them based on geometry to keep all overlapping geometry. Lastly, I clipped these census tracts to the fire perimeters in order to focus on census tracts within the fire perimeter.\n\n# Read in data EJ data\nfp = os.path.join(\"data\",\"EJI_2024_California\", \"EJI_2024_California.gdb\")\nej = gpd.read_file(fp)\n\n# Reproject crs of ej to Eaton's crs \nej = ej.to_crs(crs = eaton.crs)\n\n# Spatial join to get boundaries of census tracts and perimeter \npalisades_ej = gpd.sjoin(ej, palisades, \n                         how = \"inner\")\n\n# Spatial join to get boundaries of census tracts and perimeter \neaton_ej = gpd.sjoin(ej, eaton, \n                         how = \"inner\")\n\n# Clip census to Palisades fire perimeter\npalisades_clipped = gpd.clip(ej, palisades)\n\n# Clip census to Eaton fire perimeter\neaton_clipped = gpd.clip(ej, eaton)\n\n\nPlot Linguistic Isolation in Eaton and Palisades fire perimeters\n\nfig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(20, 10))\n\n# Select low english proficiency variable\neji_variable = 'E_LIMENG'\n\n# Find common min/max for legend range\nvmin = min(palisades_clipped[eji_variable].min(), eaton_clipped[eji_variable].min())\nvmax = max(palisades_clipped[eji_variable].max(), eaton_clipped[eji_variable].max())\n\n# Plot census tracts within Palisades perimeter\npalisades_clipped.plot(\n    column=eji_variable,\n    vmin=vmin, vmax=vmax,\n    legend=False,\n    cmap='YlOrRd',  \n    ax=ax1,\n)\nax1.set_title('Census Tracts in Palisades Fire Perimeter', fontsize=16)\nax1.axis('off')\n\n# Plot census tracts within Eaton perimeter\neaton_clipped.plot(\n    column=eji_variable,\n    vmin=vmin, vmax=vmax,\n    legend=False,\n    cmap='YlOrRd',  \n    ax=ax2,\n)\nax2.set_title('Census Tracts in Eaton Fire Perimeter', fontsize=16)\nax2.axis('off')\n\n# Add overall title\nfig.suptitle('Linguistic Isolation in LA Fire Areas (February 23, 2025)', fontsize=20)\n\n# Add shared colorbar at the bottom\nsm = plt.cm.ScalarMappable(cmap='YlOrRd', norm=plt.Normalize(vmin=vmin, vmax=vmax))  \ncbar_ax = fig.add_axes([0.25, 0.08, 0.5, 0.02])\ncbar = fig.colorbar(sm, cax=cbar_ax, orientation='horizontal')\ncbar.set_label('Percentage of the population age 5+ who speak English \"less than very well\"', fontsize=16)\n\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion: This plot higlights the fact that a significant portion of census tracts affected by the Eaton fire contained a notable percentage of the population that spoke English less than very well. This comes to show that there is a need for multilingual emergency systems. At the time the emergency system warnings were only in English and Spanish, but there are thousands of folks who do not speak either well who were affected by these fires - notably members of the Asian community (UCLA Asian American Studies Center). In the future these warnings should be translated to variety of languages to ensure everyone has access to this life saving information.\nIt is important to note the LEP metric used in this analysis includes all individuals who speak English “less than well,” which includes Spanish speakers who did receive alerts in Spanish. This means this visualizations overestimates the population that was truly excluded from emergency communications."

The confidence interval does not include month 96 which suggests something else caused this change in groundwater level trends.\nThis breakpoint, however, does align with extreme precipitation events that occured during this time. Around September 2022, California experienced record-breaking rainfall in several regions (Purohit, 2025). This replenished groundwater levels all over the state. Despite this timing strongly suggesting the extreme precipitation event caused this change in groundwater level slope, we cannot attribute the entire trend change to weather. We would need to account for seasonality and precipitation in addition to time for our model. We would also need to compare these water levels to a control group that did not experience this SGMA implementation in order to isolate the changes in groundwater level trends due to weather event and the SGMA implementation."

    "text": "Sustainable Protein Production Challenges\nWith the global population approaching 10 bilion by 2050, protein demand has continuously risen. Terrestial livestock has increased to meet this demand - degrading the environment in the process. Marine aquaculture, however, offers a attractive solution to this problem. It is associated with lower carbon emissions, reduced freshwater use, and minimal land use compared to terrestrial livestock (Gephart et al. 2021).\nImplementing this alternative requires finding locations with specific temperature, depth, and other environmental factors needed for particular marine species. Finding these optimal zones with spatial analysis would encourage sustainable aquaculture within Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) like the U.S’s West coast.\n\nResearch Question\nWhere are the most suitable locations along the U.S. West Coast for cultivating oysters and California spiny lobsters?\nThis analysis uses sea surface temperature data and ocean depth to produce a map containing optimal environmental conditions for these two commercially valuable species."

Burned car due to Eaton Fire\n\n\nFigure 1. Burned car due to Eaton Fire.\nPhoto by Frederic J. Brown/AFP via Getty Images.\n\n\n\nAbout\n\nPurpose:\nThe Eaton and Palisades fires of January 2025, exacerbated by Santa Ana winds, wreaked havoc across Southern California. Thousands of homes were burned and residents displaced.\nThis notebook uses false color imagery to visualize the aftermath of the Eaton and Palisades fires as of February 23, 2025.\nFurthermore, this analysis examines limited English proficiency (LEP) populations within the fire perimeters to highlight language barriers during emergency response. Emergency alerts were disseminated only in English and Spanish, leaving communities speaking other languages without access to life-saving information. According to UCLA researchers, nearly 50,000 Asian Americans were impacted by these fires, with over 12,000 having limited English proficiency and facing significant communication barriers.\nData Limitation: The LEP metric used in this analysis includes all individuals who speak English “less than well,” which includes Spanish speakers who did receive alerts in Spanish. This means the visualizations overestimate the population that was truly excluded from emergency communications. Ideally, this analysis would isolate non-English, non-Spanish speaking populations, but this data is not available in the current EJScreen dataset. Despite this limitation, the maps still reveal census tracts with high concentrations of language isolated populations and highlight the need for more multilingual emergency alert systems.\n\n\nHighlights:\n\nPlotting RGB true color map\nPlotting False-color image map (SWIR‑NIR‑Red)\nPlotting False-color image map (SWIR‑NIR‑Red) within Eaton and Palisades parameters\nPlotting census tracts with limited English proficiency within Eaton and Palisades parameters\n\n\n\nData descriptions:\nEaton_Perimeter_20250121.shp - This data consists of Eaton dissolved perimeter data from Los Angeles County.\nPalisades_Perimeter_20250121.shp - This data consists of Palisades dissolved perimeter data from Los Angeles County.\nlandsat8-2025-02-23-palisades-eaton.nc - This Landsat data consists of atmospherically corrected surface reflectance and surface temperature image data.\nEJI_2024_California.gdp - This data consist of several environmental justice variables and corresponsing census tracts and geometry.\n\n\nReferences:\n[1] ArcGIS Online.

Importantly xarray is used to work with multi-dimensional arrays like NETCDF. netCDF4 is used to read in data in the NetCDF format - a common format for climate/satelite data. And contextily will be used for adding a basemap to map.\n\n# Import libraries\nimport os\nimport pandas as pd\nimport geopandas as gpd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\nimport xarray as xr   \nimport netCDF4\nimport contextily as ctx\n\n\n\nRead in fire perimeter data\nThis step reads in two seperate shapefiles of the Eaton and Palisades fire perimeters represented as polygons. These contain “Heat Perimeter” polygons showing fire boundaries.\n\n# Read in Palisades and Eaton fire perimeter data \nfp_eaton = os.path.join('data','Eaton_Perimeter_20250121','Eaton_Perimeter_20250121.shp')\neaton = gpd.read_file(fp_eaton)\n\nfp_pal = os.path.join('data','Palisades_Perimeter_20250121','Palisades_Perimeter_20250121.shp')\npalisades = gpd.read_file(fp_pal)\n\n\n\nCheck fire perimeter CRS\nThe following lines of code extract the CRS of our fire perimeter data. They are both EPSG:3857, the Web Mercator projected coordinate system.\n\n# Check the projection and coordinate reference system of data \nprint(eaton.crs)\n\nEPSG:3857\n\n\n\n# Check the projection and coordinate reference system of data \nprint(palisades.crs)\n\nEPSG:3857\n\n\n\n\nExplore fire perimeter data contents\nBoth the fire perimeters contain the following columns, OBJECTID, type, Shape_Are, Shape_Len, and Geometry for each row representing an individual polygon feature. OBJECTID is an int64 type and the unique identifier, type is an object containing a string describing the feature.” Shape_Are is a float64 data type containing a number representing the area of the polygon, and Shape_Len is a float64 data type containg a number representing the length of the polygon. Lastly, the geometry column is a geometry data type containing the polygon spatial object used for mapping.\n\n# Check the first 5 rows of data \neaton.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOBJECTID\ntype\nShape__Are\nShape__Len\ngeometry\n\n\n\n\n0\n1\nHeat Perimeter\n2206.265625\n270.199719\nPOLYGON ((-13146936.686 4051222.067, -13146932...\n\n\n1\n2\nHeat Perimeter\n20710.207031\n839.204218\nPOLYGON ((-13150835.463 4052713.929, -13150831...\n\n\n2\n3\nHeat Perimeter\n3639.238281\n250.304502\nPOLYGON ((-13153094.697 4053057.596, -13153113...\n\n\n3\n4\nHeat Perimeter\n1464.550781\n148.106792\nPOLYGON ((-13145097.740 4053118.235, -13145100...\n\n\n4\n5\nHeat Perimeter\n4132.753906\n247.960744\nPOLYGON ((-13153131.126 4053196.882, -13153131...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Check the first 5 rows of data \npalisades.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOBJECTID\ntype\nShape__Are\nShape__Len\ngeometry\n\n\n\n\n0\n1\nHeat Perimeter\n1182.082031\n267.101144\nPOLYGON ((-13193543.302 4032913.077, -13193543...\n\n\n1\n2\nHeat Perimeter\n2222.488281\n185.498783\nPOLYGON ((-13193524.155 4033067.953, -13193524...\n\n\n2\n3\nHeat Perimeter\n21.011719\n22.412814\nPOLYGON ((-13193598.085 4033158.222, -13193598...\n\n\n3\n4\nHeat Perimeter\n214.992188\n76.639180\nPOLYGON ((-13193654.249 4033146.033, -13193656...\n\n\n4\n5\nHeat Perimeter\n44203.453125\n1569.259764\nPOLYGON ((-13194209.580 4033236.320, -13194209...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Check data column types \neaton.dtypes\n\nOBJECTID         int64\ntype            object\nShape__Are     float64\nShape__Len     float64\ngeometry      geometry\ndtype: object\n\n\n\n# Check data column types \npalisades.dtypes\n\nOBJECTID         int64\ntype            object\nShape__Are     float64\nShape__Len     float64\ngeometry      geometry\ndtype: object\n\n\n\n\nRead in satellite imagery data\nRead in Landsat satelite imagery from February 23, 2025 in NetCDF format using xarray.\n\n# Read in collection of bands data \nlandsat = xr.open_dataset(os.path.join(\"data\",\"landsat8-2025-02-23-palisades-eaton.nc\"))\n\n\n\nExplore satelite imagery data\nThis Landsat data is stored in a NetCDF data format with each layer being a matrix. Upon exploring this data, I found that it is 3 dimensional. it contains one layer representing time, and another two representing x and y coordinates on a map. Y coordinates decrease as you go down (south) and X coordinates increase as you go right (east). Its CRS is EPSG:32611 (UTM Zone 11N), its units are meters, and its resolution is 30 meters and it is projected. It contains the red, green, blue, nir08, and swir22 bands. Red, green, and blue bands are within the visible light spectrum humans see, they represent images in their “true color” form. Nir08 is a band within the near-infrared spectrum, vegetation is highly reflective in this spectrum. Swir22 is a band within the shortwave infrared spectrum, burn scars are highly reflective in this spectrum.\n\n# Print Landsat data and explore

region impacted by fires\nThis step plots the region of Southern California that experienced the Eaton and Palisades fires in true color imagery. This means I used the red, green, and blue band to create a map of the region. It will allow me to see what this map looked like before I plot it in false color imagery.\nOriginally, this map did not plot well - it plotted a blank map. I discovered this was due to the fact that my data contained NaN values and extreme outliers corresponding to bright clouds. The following steps will address these issues.\nIn order remove the NaNs in my data, I will turn all NaN values into zeros and print the number of NaN values to ensure they are gone. This will ensure I don’t get a warning when I plot my map.\n\n# Check number of NAs in each band\nfor band in [\"red\",\"green\",\"blue\"]:\n    print(band, np.isnan(landsat[band]).sum().item())\n\nred 0\ngreen 1\nblue 109\n\n\n\n# Substitute nan with zero \nlandsat = landsat.fillna(0)\n\n# Ensure nas are converted into zero\nfor band in [\"red\",\"green\",\"blue\"]:\n    print(band, np.isnan(landsat[band]).sum().item())\n\nred 0\ngreen 0\nblue 0\n\n\nIn order to remove the extreme outliers in my data caused by bright clouds I will use robust=true for my figure. This will remove the top and bottom 2% values in my data and allow me to plot a map without distorted colors.\n\n# Create rgb map of Southern California post-fire\nfigure = (landsat[[\"red\",\"green\",\"blue\"]].to_array()\n                                         .plot\n                                         .imshow(robust=True)) # Remove outliers with robust\n\n# Add axis labels and title\nax = figure.axes\nax.set_title(\"Southern California Landsat RGB Image (Feb 23, 2025)\")\n\n# Remove ticks \nax.set_xticks([])         \nax.set_yticks([])  \n\n# Remove x and y labels\nax.set_ylabel(\"\")\nax.set_xlabel(\"\")\n\nText(0.5, 0, '')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlot false color image of region impacted by fires\nThis step plots the region of Southern California that experienced the Eaton and Palisades fires in false color imagery. False color imagery is the practice of assigning non-rgb bands to rgb band colors in order to highlight certain features that are more visible in those non-rgb bands.\nIn this case, we plot the nir08 band as green.

Swir22 is a band within the shortwave infrared spectrum, burn scars are highly reflective in this spectrum and therefore we will visualize burn scars as red.

Then, I matched its crs to the crs for the Eaton and Palisades fire perimeters. Then, I inner joined them based on geometry to keep all overlapping geometry.

This comes to show that there is a need for multilingual emergency systems. At the time the emergency system warnings were only in English and Spanish, but there are thousands of folks who do not speak either well who were affected by these fires - notably members of the Asian community (UCLA Asian American Studies Center). In the future these warnings should be translated to variety of languages to ensure everyone has access to this life saving information.\nIt is important to note the LEP metric used in this analysis includes all individuals who speak English “less than well,” which includes Spanish speakers who did receive alerts in Spanish. This means this visualizations overestimates the population that was truly excluded from emergency communications."

    "text": "Sustainable Protein Production Challenges\nWith the global population approaching 10 billion by 2050, protein demand has continuously risen. Terrestrial livestock has increased to meet this demand - degrading the environment in the process. Marine aquaculture, however, offers an attractive solution to this problem. It is associated with lower carbon emissions, reduced freshwater use, and minimal land use compared to terrestrial livestock (Gephart et al. 2021).\nImplementing this alternative requires finding locations with specific temperature, depth, and other environmental factors needed for particular marine species. Finding these optimal zones with spatial analysis would encourage sustainable aquaculture within an Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) like the U.S’s West coast. Exclusive Economic Zones are maritime zones extending up to 200 nautical miles from a country’s coastline, a country has special rights to the exploration and use of marine resources in this zone.\n\nResearch Question\nWhere are the most suitable locations along the U.S. West Coast for cultivating oysters and California spiny lobsters?\nThis analysis uses sea surface temperature data and ocean depth to produce a map containing optimal environmental conditions for these two commercially valuable species."

    "text": "Data & Methods\n\nData Sources\nThis analysis uses the following datasets:\n\nSea Surface Temperature (SST): Average annual temperature raster tiff data (2008-2012) from NOAA Coral Reef Watch, providing a five-year baseline to capture climate variability\nOcean Depth: Bathymetry raster data from the GEBCO 2022 Grid\nEEZ Boundaries: West Coast Exclusive Economic Zone boundary shapefiles from the Flanders Marine Institute\n\n\n\nSpecies Requirements\nBased on the species-specific biological research from SeaLifeBase (Palomares and Pauly 2025), I found the following optimal conditions for my species of interest.\nOysters:\n\nDepth: 0 to -70 meters\nTemperature: 11°C to 30°C\n\nCalifornia Spiny Lobster:\n\nDepth: 0 to -150 meters\nTemperature: 14.8°C to 22.3°C\n\n\n\nAnalytical Approach\nThe analysis workflow involved:\n\nData preparation: Transforming coordinate reference systems to match spatial extents and resolutions across all datasets. This will allow us to conduct zonal statistics between them and plot them on a map together.\nTemperature processing: Calculating mean sea surface temperature (SST) (2008-2012) and converting from Kelvin to Celsius. This ensures we have a robust SST informed by the historical temperatures of the area and is in a temperature people are familiar with.\nFinding suitable areas: Reclassifying temperature and depth rasters to identify suitable areas (binary: suitable = 1, unsuitable = 0). This returns a raster that only meets our suitability condition.\nArea calculation: Calculating suitable area (km²) within each EEZ region using zonal statistics. This allows us to quantify how suitable each EEZ is based on area of suitability.\nCreate Function: Creating a function that takes in minimum sea surface temperature, maximum sea surface temperature, minimum sea depth, maximum sea depth, and species name to create a map that colors each exclusive economic zone on the US west coast by suitable area quantity in km^2. This makes the workflow generalizable.\n\n\n\nCode\n# Load in necessary libraries\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(terra)\nlibrary(here)\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(tmap)\nlibrary(knitr)\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Create raster objects for sea surface temperature\nsst_2008 &lt;- rast(here(\"posts\", \"west-coast-eez\", \"data\", \"average_annual_sst_2008.tif\"))\nsst_2009 &lt;- rast(here(\"posts\", \"west-coast-eez\", \"data\", \"average_annual_sst_2009.tif\"))\nsst_2010 &lt;- rast(here(\"posts\", \"west-coast-eez\", \"data\", \"average_annual_sst_2010.tif\"))\nsst_2011 &lt;- rast(here(\"posts\", \"west-coast-eez\", \"data\", \"average_annual_sst_2011.tif\"))\nsst_2012 &lt;- rast(here(\"posts\", \"west-coast-eez\", \"data\", \"average_annual_sst_2012.tif\"))\n\n# Create stacked raster\nsst_all &lt;- c(sst_2008, sst_2009, sst_2010, sst_2011, sst_2012)\n\n# Create raster object for sea depth\ndepth &lt;- rast(here(\"posts\", \"west-coast-eez\", \"data\", \"depth.tif\"))\n\n# Create shapefile for eez\neez &lt;- st_read(here::here(\"posts\", \"west-coast-eez\", \"data\", \"wc_regions_clean\",\"wc_regions_clean.shp\"), quiet = TRUE)\n\n# Reproject to match CRS\ndepth &lt;- project(depth, sst_all)\neez &lt;- st_transform(eez, crs = crs(sst_all))\n\n# Find mean SST and convert to Celsius\nsst_avg &lt;- app(sst_all, fun = mean, na.rm = TRUE)\nsst_avg_c &lt;- sst_avg - 273.15\n\n# Match extent and resolution\ndepth_cropped &lt;- crop(depth, sst_avg_c)\ndepth_resample &lt;- resample(depth_cropped, sst_avg_c, method = \"near\")\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Create matrix with oyster depth limits\ndepth_rcl &lt;- matrix(c(-Inf, -70, 0,\n                      -70, 0, 1, \n                      0, Inf, 0), \n                    ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE)\n\n# Reclassify raster for suitable depth\ndepth_reclassified &lt;- classify(depth_resample, rcl = depth_rcl)\n\n# Create matrix with oyster temperature limits\nsst_rcl &lt;- matrix(c(-Inf, 11, 0,\n                      11, 30, 1, \n                      30, Inf, 0), \n                    ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE)\n\n# Reclassify raster for suitable temperature\nsst_reclassified &lt;- classify(sst_avg_c, rcl = sst_rcl)\n\n# Combine suitability layers\nsuitable_oyster &lt;- lapp(c(depth_reclassified, sst_reclassified), fun = function(x, y) x * y)\n\n# Set zeros to NA and mask to EEZ\nsuitable_oyster[suitable_oyster == 0] &lt;- NA\nsuitable_oyster_eez &lt;- mask(suitable_oyster, eez)\n\n# Calculate area\nsuitable_cell_area &lt;- cellSize(suitable_oyster_eez, unit = \"km\")\nsuitable_oyster_area &lt;- suitable_oyster_eez * suitable_cell_area\n\n# Zonal statistics\neez_rast &lt;- rasterize(eez, suitable_oyster_eez, field = \"rgn\")\nsuitable_oyster_region &lt;- zonal(suitable_oyster_area, eez_rast, fun = \"sum\", na.rm = TRUE)\nnames(suitable_oyster_region)[2] &lt;- \"area_km_2\"\n\n# Join to EEZ shapefile\neez_oyster &lt;- left_join(x = eez, y = suitable_oyster_region, by = \"rgn\")"
