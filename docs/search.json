We are 95% confident this breakpoint falls between month 124 and 130 (July-November 2022). This breakpoint does not align with SGMA implementation in January 2020 (month 96). The confidence interval does not include month 96 which suggests something else caused this change in groundwater level trends.\nThis breakpoint, however, does align with extreme precipitation events that occured during this time. Around September 2022, California experienced record-breaking rainfall in several regions (Purohit, 2025). This replenished groundwater levels all over the state. Despite this timing strongly suggesting the extreme precipitation event caused this change in groundwater level slope, we cannot attribute the entire trend change to weather. We would need to account for seasonality and precipitation in addition to time for our model. We would also need to compare these water levels to a control group that did not experience this SGMA implementation in order to isolate the changes in groundwater level trends due to weather event and the SGMA implementation."
