Terrestial livestock has increased to meet this demand - degrading the environment in the process. Marine aquaculture, however, offers a attractive solution to this problem. It is associated with lower carbon emissions, reduced freshwater use, and minimal land use compared to terrestrial livestock [@Gephart2021].\n\nImplementing this alternative requires finding locations with specific temperature, depth, and other environmental factors needed for particular marine species. Finding these optimal zones with spatial analysis would encourage sustainable aquaculture within Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) like the U.S's West coast.\n\n### Research Question\n\n**Where are the most suitable locations along the U.S. West Coast for cultivating oysters and California spiny lobsters?**\n\nThis analysis uses sea surface temperature data and ocean depth to produce a map containing optimal environmental conditions for these two commercially valuable species.\n\n## Data & Methods\n\n### Data Sources\n\nThis analysis uses the following datasets:\n\n1.  **Sea Surface Temperature (SST)**: Average annual temperature data (2008-2012) from NOAA Coral Reef Watch, providing a five-year baseline to capture climate variability\n2.  **Ocean Depth**: Bathymetry data from the GEBCO 2022 Grid\n3.  **EEZ Boundaries**: West Coast Exclusive Economic Zone boundaries from the Flanders Marine Institute\n\n### Species Requirements\n\nBased on the species-specific biological research from SeaLifeBase [@Palomares2025], I found the following optimal conditions for my species of interest.\n\n**Oysters:** - Depth: 0 to -70 meters - Temperature: 11°C to 30°C\n\n**California Spiny Lobster:** - Depth: 0 to -150 meters\\\n- Temperature: 14.8°C to 22.3°C\n\n### Analytical Approach\n\nThe analysis workflow involved:\n\n1.  **Data preparation**: Transforming coordinate reference systems to match spatial extents and resolutions across all datasets\n2.  **Temperature processing**: Calculating mean SST (2008-2012) and converting from Kelvin to Celsius\n3.  **Finding suitable areas**: Reclassifying temperature and depth rasters to identify suitable areas (binary: suitable = 1, unsuitable = 0)\n4.  **Area calculation**: Calculating suitable area (km²) within each EEZ region using zonal statistics\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n## Results\n\n### Oyster Aquaculture Suitability\n\nThe analysis finds the most suitable EEZs for oyster aquaculture across the U.S. West Coast:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\nTable: Oyster Aquaculture Suitable Area per EEZ Region\n\n|EEZ Region          | Suitable Area (km²)|\n|:-------------------|-------------------:|\n|Central California  |          4,373.5565|\n|Northern California |            323.9124|\n|Oregon              |          1,395.7328|\n|Southern California |          3,329.9002|\n|Washington          |          3,091.5158|\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Central California** is found to be the most suitable region for oyster aquaculture since it contains the largest area of optimal conditions.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![West Coast EEZ regions colored by suitable oyster aquaculture area (km²).

The warmer waters of Southern California provide optimal habitat.](westcoast-eez_files/figure-html/lobster-map-1.png){width=768}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Southern California** is found to be the most suitable region for California spiny lobster aquaculture since it contains the largest area of optimal conditions - warmer waters and appropriate depth profiles.\n\n## Discussion & Implications\n\n### Key Findings\n\nThis spatial analysis maps potential aquaculture EEZs for Oyster and California spiny lobster.\n\n-   **Central California** is optimal for oyster cultivation, with moderate temperatures and shallow coastal waters\n-   **Southern California** is best suited for California spiny lobster, with warmer waters and appropriate depths\n\n### Limitations\n\nThe followint limitation should be considered:\n\n1.  **Simplified environmental criteria**: This analysis only considers temperature and depth. Additional factors should be considered in order to find more accurate optimal zones.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven the increasing demand for protein and depleted wild fisheries, marine aquaculture offers a sustainable pathway [@FAO2020]. Spatial tools like this analysis can help guide development in appropriate exclusive economic zones.
